#Code Book

This Code Book describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or 
work performed to clean up the data.

##Data

Data is housed in several files found in the UCI HAR Dataset folder.

- skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
- kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
- bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
- angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors in the dataset:
- gravityMean

##activity_lables.txt
Lists values that identify the subject's activity during the experiment.

- 1- WALKING: subject was walking during test
- 2- WALKING_UPSTAIRS: subject was walking up stairs during test
- 3- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS: subject was walking down stairs during test
- 4- SITTING: subject was sitting during test
- 5- STANDING: subject was standing during test
- 6- LAYING: subject was laying down during test

##Observational results data:
Data are found in 6 files (3 for the train data, 3 for test data). 

- 'subject_train (or test).txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'y_train(or test).txt': Each row identifies the activity class during the test.  Its range is from 1 to 6.

- 'X_train(or test).txt': Each row idenifies the measurement/calculated value for each of the variables. 

##Data Description for tidydata.txt

- Col 1 - Subject number
- Col 2 - Activity label
- Col 3-81 - Measurement for the 79 variables in features.txt above

File will have 1 header row followed by 180 rows of observation data.
