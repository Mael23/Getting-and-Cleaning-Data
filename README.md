#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work 
with, and clean a data set.

#Task
Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

- 1- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- 2- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for 
	each measurement.
- 3- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
- 4- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- 5- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
	with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
	
#To Use the Script

- 1- Save the run_analysis.R script to your local working directory.
- 2- Modify the script (line 20) to reflect the path of your working directory.
- 3- From RStudio, go to File / Open File and then select run_analysis.R.
- 4- Run source.  The script automatically installs package dependencies and 
	downloads and unzips the required data file.
- 5- The script will generate and save a new tidy data file (tidydata.txt) to
	your working directory.
